The purchasing staff is able to view the stock summary, including the total number of products stored in each location. Information such as how many stocks are received and how many are issued can also be viewed in the stock history page. The low stock alert allows staff to identify when stocks are running low and need to be purchased.

The warehouse staff can record stock in when stock is received as well as stock out when stock is issued. Stock adjustment can be made when there are cases such as stock disposal, stock spoilt or returned order. The stock take can be recorded when the staff conduct the scheduled stock count. Besides, the warehouse staff can also view the reports of stock summary and stock history. The products can be added, deleted, viewed or updated by the staff in the system.
